1. I Created a RecipeCollection class that uses a List<Recipe> to store multiple Recipe objects.

2. I Implement the ability for the user to enter unlimited recipes by repeatedly creating new Recipe objects and adding them to the RecipeCollection.

3. Modify the Recipe class to include a Name property for each recipe, and use it to sort the RecipeCollection alphabetically by name.

4. Added a method to display the list of recipes and allow the user to choose which recipe to display and 

. Add Calories and FoodGroup properties to the Ingredient class, and use them to calculate the total calories of the recipe.

5. I  Used a delegate to notify the user if the total calories of a recipe exceed 300.

6. I Wrote a unit test to verify the calculation of the total calories of a recipe.
