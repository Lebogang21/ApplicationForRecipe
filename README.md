  I  Created a RecipeCollection class that uses a List<Recipe> to store multiple Recipe objects.

2. I  Implement the ability for the user to enter unlimited recipes by repeatedly creating new Recipe objects and adding them to the RecipeCollection.

3. Modify the Recipe class to include a Name property for each recipe, and use it to sort the RecipeCollection alphabetically by name.

4. Added a method to display the list of recipes and allow the user to choose which recipe to display and 

5. Add Calories and FoodGroup properties to the Ingredient class, and use them to calculate the total calories of the recipe.

6. I  Used a delegate to notify the user if the total calories of a recipe exceed 300.

7. I Wrote a unit test to verify the calculation of the total calories of a recipe.
